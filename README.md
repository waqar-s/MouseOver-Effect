#  Dynamic Cursor Magic

**Author**: Waqar Bugti Baloch

## Description

This is a simple web project that demonstrates a dynamic cursor effect. It features an HTML page styled with CSS and enhanced with JavaScript. The cursor changes into a white circle that follows the mouse's movements within a designated container. The circle appears when the mouse is inside the container and disappears when the mouse leaves the window.
